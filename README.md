# Identity Learning Lab

Identity Learning Lab is a sandbox repository for experimenting with Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) flows, shared assets, and admin utilities. The project is organized to keep IdP/SP examples separate while sharing common modules when possible.

## Repository layout

- `admin/` — admin utilities and tooling.
- `assets/` — static assets used by demos or documentation.
- `idp/` — identity provider example implementation.
- `shared/` — shared modules and utilities.
- `sp/` — service provider example implementation.
- `index.html` — top-level landing page for local demos.

## Getting started

1. Review the subproject you want to explore (for example `idp/` or `sp/`).
2. Follow any local README or documentation inside that directory.

## Contributing

- Keep documentation up to date with any structural or workflow changes.
- Add or update README files inside subprojects when introducing new behavior.

## License

This repository does not currently declare a license. Add a license file if you intend to open source it.
